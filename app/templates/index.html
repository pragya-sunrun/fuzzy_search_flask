  <h1>Fuzzy search</h2>

  <h3 id="toc_0">&quot;Find me the butterfly book, or something like that!&quot;</h3>

  <p>When we &quot;search&quot; for something from a database, we type a few words that we think are the &quot;keywords&quot;. However, more often when what we type in keywords, what we actually mean is <strong>&quot;show me this butterfly book, or something like that&quot;</strong>. In this case, most of current web application may not give you the book that you actually want.</p>

  <p>I am building a &quot;fuzzy search&quot; app that can return results base on the similarity of meanings the search keywords. This is possible using the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/"><strong>word2vec</strong> (word to vector) model pre-trained with google news</a>, and natural language processing (NLP) skills.</p>

  <h3 id="toc_1">---&gt;<a href="/app">check out the app</a></h3>

  <p>Currently, the app is based on titles of the 500 best-selling Fiction books listed on <a href="https://www.audible.com/">audible.com</a>. User can type find <strong><a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/A-Clockwork-Orange-Audiobook/B002V1OHIW">A Clockwork Orange</a></strong> by typing in <strong>&quot;tangerine&quot;</strong> as the keyword. </p>

  <p><strong>This task is <a href="https://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_hp_tseft?advsearchKeywords=tangerine&amp;filterby=field-keywords">currently not easy on audible.com</a></strong>.</p>
