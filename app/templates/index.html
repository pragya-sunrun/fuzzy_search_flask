  <h2> with a fuzzy search app  <a href="/app"><i class="fas fa-search"></i> </a> and an emoji tagger  <a href="/emoji"><i class="far fa-smile"></i></a></h2>

    <h5 id="toc_0">Using the 1000 fiction best-sellers on audible.com, I built a fuzzy search app that allows users to find what we want even when we mess up with the keywords, and an emoji-tagger that provides a quick visual idea of people&#39;s opinion on a book.</h3>

    <div class="row">
       <div class="col-md-5">


    <p>When we search for something, we use keywords. However, we can mess up with the keywords. Say, if we type in &quot;Butterfly&quot; as the keywords when the book is actually called &quot;Dragonfly in amber&quot;. </p>

    <p>In this case, what we actually mean is <strong>&quot;find the butterfly book, or something like that&quot;</strong>. In other words, we want to be allowed some fuzziness in searching. </p>

    <p>I am building a fuzzy search app to deal with this &quot;or something like that&quot; problem. The current app can return results base on the similarity of meanings the search keywords. The model behind the app utilizes techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/" target="_blank">google <strong>word2vec</strong> word-embedding model</a>. </p>

    <p>With the word-embedding model, we can search by the meaning of the words, rather than depend strictly matching of keywords. </p>

    <p>Currently, the app is based on titles of the 500 best-selling Fiction books listed on <a href="https://www.audible.com/" target="_blank">audible.com</a>. User can type find <strong><a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/A-Clockwork-Orange-Audiobook/B002V1OHIW" target="_blank">A Clockwork Orange</a></strong> by typing in <strong>&quot;tangerine&quot;</strong> as the keyword. (<strong>This task is <a href="https://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_hp_tseft?advsearchKeywords=tangerine&amp;filterby=field-keywords" target="_blank">currently not easy on audible.com</a></strong>.)</p>

    <p>After finding a book, the next thing we usually do is browsing through online reviews. We want to get an idea of what people think about this book. Emojis provide a quick visualization of how people feel about something.</p>

    <p>I constructed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict emojis for sentences from a book reviews. Using the <strong>word2vec</strong> embedding, this task is possible (60% test accuracy) with 1,000s of labeled training examples. </p>

    <p>With emoji tagger, we can get a quick  visual idea on how other people think about a book.</p>
